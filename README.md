# Entropy-and-histogram-of-different-types-of-random-numbers

In this repository I have calculated Shannon and Tsallis entropy of different types of random number generators to check their randomness.
Also provided average value and histogram of their entropy.

Shannon Entropy:

Tsallis Entropy:

I have even used different types of PRNG using numpy and calculated their entropy.
Such as:

*exponential*

*uniform*

*normal*

*lognormal*

*triangular*

Also taken various parameters for each type of random number.
